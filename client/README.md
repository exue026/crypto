This is the frontend repo of Virtual Coin Exchange.

## Styling

Create Sass files as stylesheets, but use the .css extension when importing them in JavaScript. This is because the Sass file is compiled into a CSS file at runtime, which is what ends up being used.

## Importing modules

All JavaScript and CSS files as well as images can be imported. When importing a file, you may use a relative path or an absolute path (which is relative to `src/`).

## Testing

To run all tests, do `yarn test` in the directory root. Or, to run tests in a certain directory only, do `yarn test <path-to-directory>`.
